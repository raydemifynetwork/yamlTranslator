YAML Translation Automation with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo üöÄ
This project consists of four Python scripts that work together to split, translate, clean, and merge a large YAML file in a structured and efficient process. Below is a detailed explanation of each step:

1Ô∏è‚É£ separar.py ‚Üí Splitting a Large YAML File into Smaller Parts
Objective:
Break down large YAML files into smaller, manageable parts to facilitate translation and processing.

How It Works:
‚úÖ Reads the main YAML file (e.g., 0003_ProceduralItemGenerationSettings.yml).
‚úÖ Preserves the dictionary hierarchy while splitting the content.
‚úÖ Divides large dictionaries into smaller files, ensuring a maximum of 300 lines per file.
‚úÖ Saves each part in the chaves/ folder, using the following naming format:

```
0001_dictionaryName_01.yml  
0001_dictionaryName_02.yml  
This ensures proper reassembly later.
```
Example Input (portuguese_brazilian.yml):
```
config:
  messages:
    welcome: "Welcome!"
    error: "Something went wrong!"
  settings:
    language: "en"
    difficulty: "hard"
```
Expected Output (Split Files in chaves/):
```
# 0001_config_01.yml
config:
  messages:
    welcome: "Welcome!"
    error: "Something went wrong!"
```

```
# 0001_config_02.yml
config:
  settings:
    language: "en"
    difficulty: "hard"
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ python.py ‚Üí Automatic Translation via OpenAI
Objective:
Translate all files inside the chaves/ folder to Portuguese using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API.

How It Works:
‚úÖ Reads each file inside chaves/.
‚úÖ Sends the entire content to the OpenAI API while ensuring:

The YAML structure remains intact.
Only values are translated (keys and dictionary names remain unchanged).
Lists remain formatted correctly (- item stays in the same format).
Variables ($value) and color codes (&x, ¬ßx) are not altered.
‚úÖ Receives the translated YAML and saves it in the chaves_traduzidos/ folder with the same filename.
Example Input (chaves/0001_config_01.yml):
```
config:
  messages:
    welcome: "Welcome!"
    error: "Something went wrong!"
Expected Output (chaves_traduzidos/0001_config_01.yml):
```

```
config:
  messages:
    welcome: "Bem-vindo!"
    error: "Algo deu errado!"
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ removeryaml.py ‚Üí Removing Unwanted YAML Formatting
Objective:
Remove unnecessary formatting artifacts (```yaml and ```) that OpenAI sometimes adds.

How It Works:
‚úÖ Scans all files inside the chaves_traduzidos/ folder.
‚úÖ Detects and removes any unwanted formatting from the first and last lines.
‚úÖ Rewrites the cleaned file, ensuring correct YAML formatting.

Problem It Fixes:
Sometimes, OpenAI returns formatted YAML like this:

```
config:
  messages:
    welcome: "Bem-vindo!"
    error: "Algo deu errado!"
This can cause errors when merging the files. This script ensures that the YAML is correctly formatted.
```
4Ô∏è‚É£ juntartudo.py ‚Üí Merging All Translated Parts into a Single File
Objective:
Reassemble the translated files from chaves_traduzidos/ into a single final YAML file (config_final.yml).

How It Works:
‚úÖ Sorts files numerically (0001, 0002, 0003, ...).
‚úÖ Reads each file and merges the content while ensuring:

The original sequence is preserved.
No extra spaces between YAML blocks.
‚úÖ Saves the final merged file as config_final.yml.
Example Input (chaves_traduzidos/):
```
# 0001_config_01.yml
config:
  messages:
    welcome: "Bem-vindo!"
    error: "Algo deu errado!"
```
```
# 0001_config_02.yml
config:
  settings:
    language: "pt-br"
    difficulty: "dif√≠cil"
Expected Output (config_final.yml):
```
```
config:
  messages:
    welcome: "Bem-vindo!"
    error: "Algo deu errado!"
  settings:
    language: "pt-br"
    difficulty: "dif√≠cil"
```
üìå Full Process Summary
1Ô∏è‚É£ separar.py ‚Üí Splits a large YAML file into smaller parts to facilitate translation.
2Ô∏è‚É£ python.py ‚Üí Translates each part separately using OpenAI‚Äôs API.
3Ô∏è‚É£ removeryaml.py ‚Üí Fixes formatting errors introduced by OpenAI.
4Ô∏è‚É£ juntartudo.py ‚Üí Merges all translated parts into a final single file.

üî• Key Benefits of This Approach:
‚úÖ Avoids exceeding OpenAI's character limit.
‚úÖ Preserves the original YAML structure.
‚úÖ Ensures precise translations without modifying variables and formatting.
‚úÖ Facilitates processing and final reassembly.

This set of scripts automates YAML translation while ensuring efficiency and accuracy. üöÄ
